# Time Series Data Extract from Multi-dimensional Raster Dataset
# Statistical Analysis to Compare Between Two Models' Outputs
These scripts contain the algorithms to evaluate BETHY/DLR model outputs (GPP & NPP) against the outputs of other process-based ecosystem models (LPJ-GUESS and CASA). I created these scripts using Python as part of my internship project at the German Aerospace Agency (DLR). At DLR, I worked with the second version of the BETHY/DLR ecosystem model's outputs to evaluate the model performance. This task contributed to the ongoing updating process of the model before releasing its second version's data.
